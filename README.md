# Election_Analysis

Create an Election Analysis "PyPoll" with Python

## Overview of Project

After helping Seth and Tom submit the election audit results to the election commission, they have now requested 
some additional data to complete the audit. They are asking us to:

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
* Data Source: election_results.csv
* Software: Python 3.9.9, Visual Studio Code 1.63.0

### Written Analysis of the Election Audit


### Overview of Election
The purpose of the election audit analysis is to introduce us to Python and Visual Studio Code. We are building our foundation and layering our 
challenges so we can grasp all that is being taught. We had raw data given to us and had to deliver a result.


### Election-Audit Results:

    - How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
    
        There were 369,711 total votes cast in the election.

    - Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
        There were three counties in the precint we received the data from.
            Jefferson County received 10.5% and 38,855 votes.
            Denver received 82.8% and 306,055 votes.

## Election-Audit Summary

If we wanted to break down this data even further we could add more data points. We could modify and filter to show us how different neighborhoods or demographics voted. 
We could also filter the data to include who men and women voted for. This script can also be modified to determine patterns among the characteristics. We could test the percentage of voters by county against each candidate. This would allow us to see which candidate was the most popular within a county or geographical area.
